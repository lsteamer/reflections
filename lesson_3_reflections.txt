-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working with more than one person or I'm working on more than one computer.
When I'm ready to share my progress with more people/The world.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well.
The girls explained that sometimes you don't want to share your changes yet. Which is valid.
But also, there might be issues with integration of code when merging if GitHub was to do it all the time.
Maybe you don't want a Branch to be uploaded.
